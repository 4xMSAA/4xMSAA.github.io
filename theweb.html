        <h1>The Problems with Modern Web... and many more places.</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>This site requires JavaScript.</strong></li>
            <p>
                It feels as if sites ask for so much more than they actually need to convey me information.
                This site has <strong>no</strong> JavaScript (well, it also doesn't need it, the content is static.)
                But did I really need JavaScript to make the site contents visible? Definitely not.
                <br><br>
                <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr>s are possibly the biggest offenders of JavaScript use.

            <p>
                Now I must say, it does help a lot to have cross-platform compatibility, but I'd still prefer
                not to have <strong>every</strong> application on my computer to run their own Chromium session
                inside their own sandbox, each running their own JavaScript engine with all of the libraries
                being individually bundled for every, single, instance!
            </p></li>
