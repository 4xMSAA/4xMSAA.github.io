        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>
            I've been tinkering with computers when I was about 8 - more recently I've also set foot
            into electronics and circuit design (as a hobbyist). I tend to make software more for the
            fun of it rather than profiting off it. Sometimes I also take photos of nice scenery and
            express myself through digital painting.
        </p>
        <h2>How did I get here?</h2>
        <p>
            While I don't remember what the ignition for my path in
            <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> was, I've for sure seen and learned a lot over the
            years of writing software and designing it. Not every decision has ended up being successful,
            but that doesn't mean there wasn't a lot to take in from those failures; they can always be shared
            to other people - be it coworkers, friends or even complete strangers on the internet.
        </p>
        <h2>Preferred tools and proficiencies</h2>
        <p>
            In terms of tool preferences, I personally like these for doing my tasks:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> - all text editing and programming.
                Fairly configured with keybinds and plugins. I <strong>will</strong> find an extension
                on any other IDE I must use for Vi keybinds when possible.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/gokcehan/lf">lf</a> - terminal, configurable curses-based file navigation,
                much like <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">ranger</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://krita.org/">Krita</a> - illustration and painting</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> - photo editing and quick whiteboarding</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> - 3D modelling and video editing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There's certainly more I feel proficient in, but these just happen to be the ones I frequent at the time of writing.
        </p>
        <h2>What I like</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Minimalism.</strong> Taking from the UNIX philosophy, "do one thing, and do it well" is a great phrase that
                a lot of software developers should hear. Most often than not a lot of software reimplements something that
                my system can already do anyway - and it probably does it worse. Why not rely on standard in/out more often as well?
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Freedom.</strong> Standing up for my right to freedom - especially in the digital world is great.<br>
                You don't have to <strong>endure automatic updates</strong> by a corporation with "best interests."<br>
                You don't have to <strong>install unknown software</strong> with no source code in sight and hope it does the right thing.<br>
                You don't have to go through <strong>enforced ads</strong> on corporation-provided applications. Usually, there are just
                better alternatives to them (especially in the Linux/BSD world.)
                <br>
                There's honestly so much more benefits to this than I can possibly list (even political ones,) but the biggest part would be:
                <strong>you're free to learn what happens under the hood</strong>, quite literally like on an average vehicle.
                <br>
                I'd encourage checking out <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about">Free Software Foundation</a> for a lot more on this.
        </ul>
        <h2>What I don't like</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>
                <strong>This site requires JavaScript.</strong> It feels as if sites ask for so much more than they
                need to convey some text information. This site has <strong>no</strong> JavaScript. Well, it also doesn't need it,
                because the content is static. But did I really need JavaScript to make the site more pretty? No.
                Some sites do atleast some sort of server-side rendering for their <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPAs</abbr>
                which is great, honestly, because 8 out of 10 times, I will never visit your site again (I will not toggle on JS for your site.)
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong><a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>.</strong> Now it'd be wrong to say that it helps a lot to have cross-platform
                compatibility, I'd really prefer not to have <strong>every</strong> application on my computer to run their own
                Chromium session inside their own sandbox each running their own JavaScript engine with
                all of the libraries being individually bundled for every... single... instance!
                <br>
                If this is the choice you're taking, then it'd be nice of you to expose some sort of API
                that other people can work with to make their own clients. <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>
                is rather the biggest offender of this - especially with its popularity in even universities here...
            </p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What I don't like... a lot.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Smartphones and manufacturers locking users.</strong> When I as an user purchase a device which I possess
                physical access over, why must the manufacturer lock me out of the device and make it as tedious
                as possible? Sure, if you lose your phone... it helps. But this is used to do more harm than good most times;
                taking a look through the Play Store shows the absurd amount of applications that have advertisements.
                More often than not, they're annoyingly intrusive and hard to tap away. An average consumer has become
                accustomed to this type of... "bull poop," but you could call this a "violation" of digital freedom.
                <br>
                (There's a solution to this and it's called <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid.</a>)
            </p>
            <p>
                As if Play Store wasn't enough of an example - <strong>what about the apps that come bundled with your smartphone?</strong>
                Sometimes, these absurd applications that are almost never used are forcibly kept on your device. The
                solution is to root your device and get rid of them, but this process is always a nuisance,
                varying from device to device. Can we really not offer a button for it in say, developer settings?
                I'm no expert on the smartphone world, but...
                All I'd envision that would be needed is a lockscreen password to enable root access.
