            I've been tinkering with computers when I was about eight - more recently I've also set foot
            into electronics and circuit design (as a hobbyist). I tend to make software/games more for the
            fun of it than for profit. Sometimes I also take photos of nice scenery and
            express myself through digital painting.
        </p>
        <h2>How did I get here?</h2>
        <p>
            I don't really remember what the ignition for my path in
            <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> was, I've for sure seen and learned a lot over the
            years of writing software and designing it. Not every decision in it has ended up being successful,
            but that doesn't mean there wasn't a lot to take in from those failures; they can always be shared
            to other people - be it coworkers, friends or even complete strangers on the internet.
        </p>
        <h2>Preferred tools and proficiencies</h2>
        <p>
            In terms of tool preferences, I personally like these for doing my tasks:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> - all text editing and programming.
                Fairly configured with keybinds and plugins. I <strong>will</strong> find an extension
                on any other IDE I must use for Vi keybinds when possible.
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/gokcehan/lf">lf</a> - terminal, configurable
                <a href="https://github.com/gdamore/tcell">tcell</a>-based file navigation,
                much like <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">ranger</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://krita.org/">Krita</a> - illustration and painting</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> - photo editing and quick whiteboarding</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> - 3D modelling and video editing</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> - for all documents and presentations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There's certainly more I feel proficient in, but these just happen to be the ones I frequent at the time of writing.
