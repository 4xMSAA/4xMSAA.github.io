        <h1>Freedom in Computing</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Freedom.</strong> The right to free core utilities of my system. This sounds too geeky,
            so let's simplify it for an average joe:<br>
            You don't have to <strong>endure automatic updates</strong> by a corporation with "best interests" whenever they want.<br>
            You don't have to <strong>install unknown software</strong> with no means of trust in sight and hope it does the right thing.<br>
            You can find plenty of alternatives to your tool suite in the Linux/BSD world. Something asks for a subscription?
            Find a free alternative that's made by people who are more open with their program.
            <br><br>
            There's so many more benefits to this than I can possibly list (even political ones) but the biggest part would be:
            <strong>you're free to learn what happens under the hood</strong>, quite literally like on an average vehicle.
            <br>
            I'd encourage checking out <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about">Free Software Foundation</a> for a lot more on this.<br>

        <h2>Disgusting things in the smartphone market</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Smartphones and manufacturers locking users.</strong> When I as an user purchase a device which I possess
            physical access over, why must the manufacturer lock me out of the device and make it as tedious
            as possible? Sure, if you lose your phone... it helps.
            But this is used to do more harm than good most times; taking a look through the Play Store shows the absurd
            amount of applications that have paid features or advertisements despite their functionality.
            More often than not, they're annoyingly intrusive and hard to tap away. An average consumer has become
            accustomed to this type of... "bull poop," but you could call this a "violation" of digital freedom.
            <br><br>
            <i>(There's a solution to the app store market, see <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid.</a>)</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            As if Play Store wasn't enough of an example - <strong>what about the apps that come bundled with your smartphone?</strong>
            Sometimes, these absurd applications that are almost never used are forcibly kept on your device.
            What if you don't like the core applications provided by your manufacturer? Maybe the provided camera application
            just isn't enough? Why would you want to keep it around? But no, the user is not to be trusted with their own hardware.<br>
            Here's the fun part. You can root your device, but the moment you do, you're on Google's "watch list" for a modified
            device. <i>Probably cause they don't want you going around their advertisement system.</p>
        </p>
        <h2>Right to Repair</h2>
        <p>
            I'll write about this some day as well. What a terrible world we live in.
